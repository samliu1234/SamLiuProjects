Hey there, this is my grade 11 final project, Blackjack. This game was created using a library called "arc," so the Java code may look a bit unconventional. The .java file that you will need to open is at the bottom of the folder.

This project was created on Geany, so the preferred way to run the program is through Geany, but other apps should be okay.

All the images and code in this project are my own.
